## What Is Drash?

Drash is an HTTP microframework for Deno's HTTP server. It has zero third-party dependencies outside of Deno Standard Modules. It is designed to help you build performant, scalable projects quickly.

Some examples of applications you can build are:

* APIs
* Web apps
* Single page applications
* Static HTML sites

## Why Use Drash?

Drash takes concepts from the following ...

* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) — being micro and extensible
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) — use of similarly styled middleware
* [Tonic](https://github.com/peej/tonic) — use of resources
* RESTful principles — content negotiation, HTTP verbs, URIs, etc.

... and revamps those concepts into a developer UX focused framework.

Although there is more boilerplate code in a Drash application, you can be confident that your application will be maintainable, scalable, performant, and fun to code -- no matter its size.

## Versioning

Drash will (and always will) follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
