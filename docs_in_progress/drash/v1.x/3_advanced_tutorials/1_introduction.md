# About the Advanced Tutorials

The advanced tutorials assume you have read through the following tutorial
sections:

- Resources
- Servers
- Requests

Understanding the above sections is crucial to understanding all of the moving
parts in any advanced tutorial. Since all advanced tutorials have example code
to create an application, it is not required that you read the above sections.
However, it is greatly recommended.

All advanced tutorials come as a series of tutorial parts. The parts are ordered
in a way to help you build towards the tutorial's end state from scratch. In
each part, you will see a **Folder Structure End State** section. This section
shows you what your project's folder structure should look like by the time you
finish the part you are viewing. In addition, there will be a **Verification**
section to help you match your end state to the tutorial's end state.
