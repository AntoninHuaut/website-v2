# Using Drash Middleware Modules

Drash has a middleware repository that contains a collection of middleware
modules. The repository contains _only_ Drash-approved middleware modules. They
are extensively documented and tested. Moreover, just like the tutorial pages
you see on this website, there are tutorials in the repository that show you how
to use each middleware module.

_Note: Be aware that some modules MAY use third-party dependencies whilst some
will not._

Although Drash provides a repository of middleware modules that you can easily
plug straight into your Drash application, feel free to create your own
middleware modules that suit your needs. Using Drash-approved middleware is not
required to build a great Drash application.
