## Overview

Line is a class-based, command-line interface (CLI) framework for Deno. It has
zero third-party dependencies outside of Deno Standard Modules. It is designed
to help you build standardized CLIs.

## Concepts

Line's maintainers have taken concepts from the following ...

- [Cilex](https://github.com/Cilex/Cilex) — being micro and extensible
- [Laravel Artisan Console](https://laravel.com/docs/artisan) — use of classes
  to build commands

... and mixed in their own concepts and practices such as ...

- Developer UX
- Approachability
- Test-driven development
- Documentation-driven development
- Transparency
