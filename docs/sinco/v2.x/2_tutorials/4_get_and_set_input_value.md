## Before You Get Started

Sinco provides a method to get the value associated with an input element that is present on the page.

Sinco provides another method for setting the value of an input element by a selector.

In this tutorial, you will:

* Create a headless browser instance;
* Set the value for an input element;
* Get the value associated with a specific input element; and
* Assert that value is correct.

## Folder Structure End State

```text
â–¾ /path/to/your/project/
  app_test.ts
  deps.ts
```

## Steps

1. Create your `app_test.ts` file.

  ```typescript
  // app.ts

  // Note that you will need to import assertEquals from https://deno.land/std/testing/asserts.ts
  import { buildFor, assertEquals } from "./deps.ts";

  Deno.test("My web app works as expected", async () => {
    const Sinco = await buildFor("chrome");
    await Sinco.goTo("https://chromestatus.com");
    await Sinco.type('input[placeholder="Filter"]', "hello world");
    const val = await Sinco.getInputValue('input[placeholder="Filter"]');
    assertEquals(val, "hello world");
    await Sinco.done();
  })
  ```

In this tutorial, you are creating a new browser instance that is pointing to https://chromestatus.com, then you will type a value into an input field, just so the field is populated with a value. After, you will get the value from that input field and assert it equals the value you typed.

## Verification

1. Run your test.

  ```shell
  $ deno test --allow-run --allow-net --allow-read app_test.ts
  ```

2. All of your tests should pass
