## Before You Get Started

You can get a value from a request's URL query params by using the following in a resource:

```typescript
const param = request.queryParam("param_name");
```

## Folder Structure End State

```text
â–¾ /path/to/your/project/
  app.ts
  deps.ts
```

## Steps

1. Create your `app.ts` file. Your resource in this file will check for the `name` param in the request's body. If it exists, then it will return what was passed in. If it does not exist, then it will throw a `400 Bad Request` response.

  ```typescript
  // app.ts

  import { Drash } from "./deps.ts";

  // Create your resource
   
  class HomeResource extends Drash.Http.Resource {
   
    public paths = ["/"];
   
    public GET(request: Drash.Request, response: Drash.Response): void {
      const param = request.queryParam("name");
   
      if (!param) {
        throw new Drash.Errors.HttpError(
          400,
          "This resource requires the `name` URL query param."
        );
      }
   
      return response.text(`You passed in the following URL query param: ${param}`);
    }
   
  }

  // Create and run your server

  const server = new Drash.Server({
    hostname: "0.0.0.0",
    port: 1447,
    protocol: "http",
    resources: [
      HomeResource
    ],
  });

  server.run();

  console.log(`Server running at ${server.address}.`);
  ```

## Verification

1. Run your app.

  ```shell
  $ deno run --allow-net app.ts
  ```

2. Using `curl` (or similar command), make a `GET` request to `http://localhost:1447?name=deno`.

  ```text
  $ curl http://localhost:1447?name=deno
  ```

  You should receive the following response:

  ```text
  You passed in the following URL query param: deno
  ```

2. Make the same request, but change the URL query param to use `username` instead of `name`.

  ```text
  $ curl http://localhost:1447?username=deno
  ```

  You should receive the following response:

  ```text
  This resource requires the `name` URL query param.
  ```
